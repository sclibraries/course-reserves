```json
{
  "totalEvents": 150,
  "uniqueUsers": 45,
  "termsActive": 3,
  "eventTypes": [
    {"event_type": "view", "count": 100},
    {"event_type": "download", "count": 50}
  ],
  "termData": [
    {"term": "Fall 2024", "count": 80, "uniqueUsers": 25, "eventTypes": 3},
    {"term": "Spring 2024", "count": 70, "uniqueUsers": 20, "eventTypes": 2}
  ],
  "events": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "event_type": "view",
      "course_name": "Introduction to Psychology",
      "college": "CAS",
      "term": "Fall 2024",
      "user_id": "user123",
      "ip_address": "192.168.1.1",
      "created_at": "2024-10-15T10:30:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🏃‍♂️ Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**: No new dependencies required (uses existing Recharts and Reactstrap)
2. **Import Components**: The new components are automatically integrated
3. **API Setup**: Ensure the course-detail endpoint is available
4. **Test Exports**: Verify CSV downloads work in your browser environment

## 🎨 Styling Notes

- Uses existing Bootstrap/Reactstrap classes for consistency
- Chart colors follow the existing COLORS and CAMPUS_COLORS constants
- Responsive design maintained throughout
- Loading states use existing spinner components

## 📈 Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: Course details are only fetched when modal opens
- **Efficient Exports**: CSV generation happens client-side to reduce server load
- **Caching**: Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed course details
- **Pagination**: Large datasets are properly paginated

## 🔍 Testing Recommendations

1. **Export Functionality**: Test CSV downloads with various data sizes
2. **Modal Performance**: Verify course detail modal loads quickly
3. **Chart Rendering**: Ensure charts display correctly with different data sets
4. **Error Handling**: Test behavior when API endpoints are unavailable
5. **Responsive Design**: Verify functionality on different screen sizes

This enhancement package significantly improves the user experience by providing better data access, detailed course insights, and professional-grade export capabilities.
