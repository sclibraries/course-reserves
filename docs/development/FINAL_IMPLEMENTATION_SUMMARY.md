# Form Component Improvements - Final Implementation Summary

## ✅ All Requirements Completed

### 1. **Documentation Organization** 
- ✅ Moved all .md files to `docs/development/`
  - `docs/development/FORM_VISIBILITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md`
  - `docs/development/FORM_IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md`

### 2. **CSS File Organization**
- ✅ Moved CSS file to proper location: `src/css/UnifiedVisibilityControl.css`
- ✅ Updated import paths in components
- ✅ Added navigation styling for anchor links

### 3. **Media Type Default Behavior - Links Default to Term Dates**
- ✅ **Primary Links**: Media types now default primary link visibility dates to current term dates
- ✅ **Additional Links**: Media types default additional link visibility dates to current term dates
- ✅ **New Links**: When adding new links to media types, they automatically get term dates and visibility enabled

**Implementation Details:**
```javascript
// In BaseResourceForm.jsx - Primary link defaults
primary_link_start_visibility: initialData.primary_link_start_visibility || (isVideoType ? defaultDates.startDate : ''),
primary_link_end_visibility: initialData.primary_link_end_visibility || (isVideoType ? defaultDates.endDate : ''),

// Additional links initialization for media types
if (isVideoType) {
  return existingLinks.map(link => ({
    ...link,
    start_visibility: link.start_visibility || defaultDates.startDate,
    end_visibility: link.end_visibility || defaultDates.endDate,
    use_link_visibility: link.use_link_visibility !== undefined ? link.use_link_visibility : true
  }));
}

// New links automatically get term dates for video types
use_link_visibility: isVideoType // Auto-enable for video types
```

### 4. **Visibility Toggle Behavior Fixed**
- ✅ **"Enable visibility date restrictions"** checkbox is NO LONGER automatically checked for media types
- ✅ Media types show informational message suggesting visibility controls but don't force them
- ✅ Staff must manually enable visibility restrictions even for media types

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Removed auto-enable for video types
const [useVisibilityDates, setUseVisibilityDates] = useState(
  // Only enable by default if dates were previously set (not for new video types)
  !!(initialData.start_visibility || initialData.end_visibility)
);
```

### 5. **Primary to Additional Links Date Cascading**
- ✅ When primary link dates are changed, they automatically cascade to additional links that have visibility enabled
- ✅ Only affects links with `use_link_visibility: true`
- ✅ Real-time synchronization as staff types

**Implementation:**
```javascript
const handlePrimaryLinkDateChange = (e) => {
  const { name, value } = e.target;
  setFormData(prev => ({ ...prev, [name]: value }));
  
  // Auto-cascade primary link dates to additional links if they have visibility enabled
  if (name === 'primary_link_start_visibility' || name === 'primary_link_end_visibility') {
    const dateField = name === 'primary_link_start_visibility' ? 'start_visibility' : 'end_visibility';
    
    setLinks(prevLinks => 
      prevLinks.map(link => 
        link.use_link_visibility 
          ? { ...link, [dateField]: value }
          : link
      )
    );
  }
};
```

### 6. **Form Navigation Anchor Links**
- ✅ Added sticky navigation component at top of form
- ✅ Smooth scrolling to form sections
- ✅ Dynamic navigation items based on form content
- ✅ Visual indicators for sections with content

**Features:**
- **Basic Info** - Always visible
- **Classification** - Material type and folder selection
- **Type Details** - Only shows when material type has specific fields
- **Links** - Shows badge when additional links exist
- **Visibility** - Visibility settings section

**Component:** `FormNavigationAnchor.jsx`
```javascript
<FormNavigationAnchor
  hasMaterialTypeFields={!!formData.material_type_id && materialTypeFields.length > 0}
  hasAdditionalLinks={links.length > 0}
/>
```

## 🎯 **Key Behavior Changes**

### **For Media/Video Material Types (ID = 3):**

1. **New Resources:**
   - Primary link gets term dates automatically
   - Additional links get term dates automatically  
   - Additional links have visibility enabled by default
   - **BUT** the main visibility toggle is NOT automatically checked
   - Staff sees informational message about visibility controls

2. **Adding New Links:**
   - New additional links automatically get term dates
   - New additional links have visibility enabled by default
   - Immediate consistency with media type expectations

3. **Date Synchronization:**
   - When primary link dates change, they cascade to additional links with visibility enabled
   - Real-time updates as staff modifies dates
   - Only affects links that have chosen to use visibility dates

### **For Non-Media Material Types:**
1. **No automatic date population**
2. **No automatic visibility enablement**
3. **Manual configuration required**
4. **Cascading still works when enabled**

## 🚀 **Enhanced User Experience**

### **Navigation Benefits:**
- **Quick Access**: Jump to any form section instantly
- **Progress Tracking**: See which sections have content
- **Reduced Scrolling**: Especially valuable for long forms
- **Sticky Positioning**: Always accessible while filling out form

### **Smart Defaults for Media:**
- **Time-Saving**: Media resources get sensible defaults immediately
- **Consistency**: All media links use same term dates by default
- **Flexibility**: Staff can still override individual settings
- **Clear Intent**: Informational messages explain automatic behavior

### **Improved Date Management:**
- **Synchronization**: Primary link changes cascade to additional links
- **Selective**: Only affects links with visibility enabled
- **Real-time**: Updates happen as staff types
- **Predictable**: Clear logic for when cascading occurs
