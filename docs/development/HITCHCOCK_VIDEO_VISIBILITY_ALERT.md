# Hitchcock Video Visibility Alert Implementation

## ✅ Changes Made

### **Enhanced User Experience for Hitchcock Videos**

Added a prominent alert at the top of the visibility settings that appears specifically for Hitchcock video URLs to immediately inform staff why automatic visibility has been applied.

### **Key Features**

1. **🎯 URL Pattern Detection**
   - Detects URLs starting with `https://ereserves.smith.edu/hitchcock/videos/`
   - Only shows alert for Hitchcock videos with automatic visibility enabled

2. **📋 Prominent Alert Placement**
   - Moved visibility summary to the top of the component
   - Added Hitchcock-specific alert right after the header
   - Uses warning color to ensure visibility

3. **💡 Clear Messaging**
   - Explains WHY visibility is automatically applied
   - References licensing requirements
   - Confirms term-limited access

### **Alert Message**

```
⚠️ Automatic Link Visibility Applied: The primary link to this Hitchcock video can only be displayed during the current term. 
Link visibility dates have been automatically set to ensure compliance.
```

### **Alert Placement**

The alert appears at the **very top of the form**, above the navigation anchor links, ensuring maximum visibility for staff members.

### **Key Messaging Clarity**

- **"Automatic Link Visibility Applied"** - Clearly indicates this is about link-level, not resource-level visibility
- **"The primary link to this Hitchcock video"** - Specifically identifies which element has restrictions
- **"Link visibility dates have been automatically set"** - Clarifies that link visibility settings were modified

### **Display Logic**

The alert only appears when **ALL** conditions are met:
- ✅ Primary URL starts with `https://ereserves.smith.edu/hitchcock/videos/`
- ✅ Primary link visibility is enabled (`usePrimaryLinkVisibility = true`)

### **Component Layout (New Order)**

1. **🚨 Hitchcock Alert** - (Only for applicable videos) **TOP OF FORM**
2. **🧭 Navigation Anchors** - Form section quick links
3. **📝 Form Sections** - Basic Information, Classification, etc.
4. **📊 Visibility Summary** - Current settings overview (within visibility card)
5. **ℹ️ Media Type Info** - (Only for non-Hitchcock videos within visibility card)
6. **⚙️ Settings Sections** - Resource, Primary Link, Additional Links

### **Files Modified**

#### **BaseResourceForm.jsx**
- ✅ Added Alert import to reactstrap imports
- ✅ Added Hitchcock video detection logic above FormNavigationAnchor
- ✅ Alert appears at top of form for maximum visibility

#### **UnifiedVisibilityControl.jsx**  
- ✅ Removed Hitchcock alert from visibility card
- ✅ Kept video type alert for non-Hitchcock videos
- ✅ Maintained all other visibility functionality

### **User Workflow Impact**

#### **Before:**
- Staff had to scroll down to see current visibility settings
- No explanation of why Hitchcock videos get automatic visibility
- Confusing when visibility was enabled automatically

#### **After:**
- **🎯 Alert at very top** of form above all other content
- **📢 Clear, specific message** about link-level visibility restrictions
- **✅ Immediate visibility** - first thing staff sees when opening Hitchcock video forms
- **🔗 Distinguishes between** resource-level and link-level visibility settings
- **🧭 Doesn't interfere** with navigation or other form elements

### **Testing Scenarios**

#### **✅ Hitchcock Video with Auto-Visibility**
- URL: `https://ereserves.smith.edu/hitchcock/videos/example`
- Primary link visibility: Enabled
- **Expected:** Orange warning alert explaining automatic visibility

#### **✅ Hitchcock Video without Auto-Visibility**  
- URL: `https://ereserves.smith.edu/hitchcock/videos/example`
- Primary link visibility: Disabled
- **Expected:** No special alert (normal workflow)

#### **✅ Non-Hitchcock Video**
- URL: `https://example.com/video`
- Material type: Audio/Video Media
- **Expected:** Standard blue info alert for video types

#### **✅ Non-Video Content**
- Any other URL and material type
- **Expected:** No special alerts, standard visibility controls

### **Benefits**

1. **🔍 Immediate Understanding** - Staff can see at a glance what visibility settings are active
2. **📚 Educational** - Explains licensing compliance requirements
3. **🎯 Context-Aware** - Only shows relevant information when needed
4. **⚡ Efficient Workflow** - Reduces confusion and support requests

This implementation provides transparent, context-aware messaging that helps staff understand when and why automatic visibility controls are applied to Hitchcock video resources.
