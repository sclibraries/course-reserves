# CourseRecords Component Refactoring

## Overview

The CourseRecords component has been refactored to follow SOLID principles and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) patterns. This refactoring improves maintainability, testability, and reusability while maintaining backward compatibility.

## SOLID Principles Applied

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **Before**: The original `CourseRecords` component handled business logic, state management, and presentation
- **After**: Separated into focused components:
  - `CourseRecordsContainer`: Business logic and state management
  - `CourseRecordsDisplay`: Pure presentation logic
  - `RecordStats`: Statistics display
  - Custom hooks for specific responsibilities

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- Components are open for extension through:
  - `options` prop for configuration
  - `onRecordAction` callback for extensible behavior
  - Pluggable custom hooks

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- The refactored `CourseRecords` maintains the same interface as the original
- New components can be substituted without breaking existing code

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Components receive only the props they actually need
- Clear, focused interfaces prevent unnecessary dependencies

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- Components depend on abstractions (hooks) rather than concrete implementations
- Business logic is abstracted into custom hooks

## DRY Improvements

### 1. Accordion Management
- **Before**: Accordion state logic was duplicated across multiple components
- **After**: Centralized in `useAccordionManager` custom hook
- **Benefits**: Reusable, testable, consistent behavior

### 2. Record Processing Logic
- **Before**: Record grouping and processing scattered throughout components
- **After**: Centralized in `useCourseRecords` custom hook
- **Benefits**: Single source of truth, easier to test and maintain

### 3. Component Architecture
- **Before**: Monolithic component mixing concerns
- **After**: Container/Presentational pattern with clear separation
- **Benefits**: Better testability, reusability, and maintainability

## File Structure

```
src/
├── hooks/
│   ├── useAccordionManager.js      # Reusable accordion state management
│   └── useCourseRecords.js         # Course records business logic
└── components/page-sections/course-record/
    ├── CourseRecords.jsx           # Main component (refactored wrapper)
    ├── CourseRecordsContainer.jsx  # Business logic container
    ├── CourseRecordsDisplay.jsx    # Presentation component
    ├── RecordStats.jsx             # Statistics display component
    ├── RecordCard.jsx              # Individual record display (existing)
    └── RecordSkeleton.jsx          # Loading skeleton (existing)
```

## Custom Hooks

### `useAccordionManager`
Provides reusable accordion state management with support for:
- Single or multiple open accordions
- Group-based organization
- Comprehensive state management utilities

**Usage:**
```javascript
const accordionManager = useAccordionManager({ 
  allowMultiple: true,
  initialState: {} 
});
```

### `useCourseRecords`
Encapsulates course records business logic including:
- Record processing and grouping
- Statistics calculation
- Filtering capabilities
- Validation utilities

**Usage:**
```javascript
const recordsManager = useCourseRecords(records, {
  enableFiltering: true,
  groupByInstanceId: true,
});
```

## Component Architecture

### CourseRecordsContainer
- **Purpose**: Business logic and state management
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Data processing using custom hooks
  - Event handling
  - State initialization
  - Error handling

### CourseRecordsDisplay
- **Purpose**: Pure presentation logic
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Rendering UI elements
  - Displaying data received via props
  - User interaction handling (delegates to container)

### RecordStats
- **Purpose**: Statistics display
- **Features**:
  - Compact and full display modes
  - Customizable styling
  - Automatic hiding when no data

## Benefits of Refactoring

### 1. Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to locate and fix bugs
- Simpler to add new features

### 2. Testability
- Components can be tested in isolation
- Custom hooks can be unit tested separately
- Mocking dependencies is straightforward

### 3. Reusability
- Custom hooks can be used in other components
- Presentation components are highly reusable
- Business logic is portable

### 4. Performance
- Better memoization opportunities
- Reduced unnecessary re-renders
- Cleaner dependency arrays

### 5. Code Quality
- Comprehensive PropTypes validation
- Better error handling
- Improved documentation

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Usage
The refactored component maintains backward compatibility:

```javascript
// This continues to work exactly as before
<CourseRecords
  records={records}
  availability={availability}
  courseInfo={courseInfo}
  customization={customization}
  collegeParam={collegeParam}
/>
```

### For Advanced Usage
New capabilities can be leveraged:

```javascript
// With additional options and callbacks
<CourseRecordsContainer
  records={records}
  availability={availability}
  courseInfo={courseInfo}
  customization={customization}
  collegeParam={collegeParam}
  options={{
    enableFiltering: true,
    filterCriteria: (record) => record.isElectronic,
    showStats: true,
  }}
  onRecordAction={(action, record, data) => {
    console.log('Record action:', action, record, data);
  }}
/>
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test custom hooks independently
- Test presentation components with mock data
- Test business logic in container components

### Integration Tests
- Test component interaction
- Test data flow between components
- Test accordion state management

### Example Test Structure
```javascript
describe('useCourseRecords', () => {
  it('should group records by instance ID', () => {
    // Test hook logic
  });
  
  it('should calculate correct statistics', () => {
    // Test stats calculation
  });
});

describe('CourseRecordsDisplay', () => {
  it('should render records correctly', () => {
    // Test presentation logic
  });
});
```

## Performance Considerations

### Memoization
- Custom hooks use `useMemo` and `useCallback` appropriately
- Presentation components can be wrapped with `React.memo` if needed
- Props are structured to minimize unnecessary re-renders

### State Management
- Accordion state is efficiently managed
- Record processing is memoized
- Statistics are computed only when needed

## Future Enhancements

The refactored architecture makes it easy to add:
- Different display modes (list, grid, table)
- Advanced filtering and sorting
- Real-time updates
- Accessibility improvements
- Performance optimizations

## Conclusion

This refactoring significantly improves the codebase by:
- Following established design principles (SOLID, DRY)
- Creating reusable, testable components
- Maintaining backward compatibility
- Providing a foundation for future enhancements

The new architecture is more maintainable, scalable, and follows React best practices while preserving the existing functionality.
