# Edit Modal Fix Summary
## Issue: Missing Edit Modal After ResourceFormManager Removal

### Date: June 23, 2025

## Problem
After removing the duplicate `ResourceFormManager` from `AdminResourceTable.jsx` to fix the duplicate toast messages, the edit modal stopped appearing when clicking "Edit" on resources.

## Root Cause
The `AdminResourceTable` was using its own instance of `useResourceFormModal()` hook, but when I removed the `ResourceFormManager` component, there was no longer a modal to render. The parent component (`AdminElectronicResources.jsx`) had its own separate instance of the modal hook, so they weren't sharing state.

## Solution
**Shared Modal State**: Instead of each component having its own modal state, I made them share the same modal instance by passing the `resourceFormModal` object as a prop down through the component hierarchy.

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Updated `AdminResourceTable.jsx`
- **Removed**: Local `useResourceFormModal()` hook
- **Added**: `editResourceModal` as a required prop
- **Updated**: PropTypes to include the new prop

#### 2. Updated `AdminResourcesTabs.jsx`
- **Added**: `editResourceModal` prop to function signature
- **Passed**: The prop down to `AdminResourceTable`
- **Updated**: PropTypes to include the new prop

#### 3. Updated `AdminElectronicResources.jsx`
- **Passed**: `resourceFormModal` as `editResourceModal` prop to `AdminResourcesTabs`

## Architecture Flow
```
AdminElectronicResources.jsx
├── resourceFormModal = useResourceFormModal()
├── <ResourceFormManager isOpen={resourceFormModal.isOpen} ... />
└── <AdminResourcesTabs editResourceModal={resourceFormModal} ... />
    └── <AdminResourceTable editResourceModal={editResourceModal} ... />
```

## Benefits
✅ **Single Source of Truth**: One modal state shared across all components
✅ **No Duplicate Modals**: Only one ResourceFormManager renders the modal
✅ **Consistent State**: Edit actions from table sync with the main modal
✅ **Clean Architecture**: Clear data flow from parent to children

## Testing
- Click "Edit" on any resource in the table
- Modal should appear with the resource data pre-filled
- Form submission should work correctly
- Only one success toast should appear

## Files Modified
- ✅ `/src/components/page-sections/admin/AdminResourceTable.jsx`
- ✅ `/src/components/page-sections/admin/electronic-resources/AdminResourcesTabs.jsx`  
- ✅ `/src/pages/AdminElectronicResources.jsx`
- ✅ Build successful with no errors
